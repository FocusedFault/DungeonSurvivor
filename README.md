# Dungeon Survivor

My first game made for a Udemy course, a 2D Survivor style roguelite game made in Godot. 

Fight through a dungeon of enemies for 5 minutes to win, gaining upgrades and weapons along the way. Metaupgrades are available after winning/losing and there's an options tab for sound/screen settings. Enjoy!

Available to play locally on [Itch.io](https://nuxlar.itch.io/dungeon-survivor) or play in the browser at [Gotm.io](https://gotm.io/nuxlar/dungeon-survivor) (browser version might be laggier/buggier due to limitations).
